This is a post I originially posted in Towards Data Science. This post introduces a way to incorporate the Pytorch-transformers model into fastai framework, after the update of Pytorch-transformers.

The post to the article is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/best-of-two-worlds-pytorch-transformers-meets-fastai-5fd51ef34b0f){:target="_blank"}



And the corresponding notebook could be found [here](https://github.com/DavidykZhao/Pytorch_transformers_Fastai/blob/master/Pytorch_transformers_Fastai.ipynb){:target="_blank"}


Please feel free to let me know any questions you may encounter in incorporating the two frameworks
