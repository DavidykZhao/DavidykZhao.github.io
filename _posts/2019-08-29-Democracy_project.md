This is a project I collaborated with [Dr. Kirby Goidel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirby_Goidel){:target="_blank" and [Dr. Nicholas Davis](https://psc.ua.edu/people/dr-nicholas-davis/){:target="_blank"}.

We used Latent Class/profile Analysis on the measurements of democracy across the globe (22 countries) and also for each country. Interesting patterns revealed suggesting a more nuanced and cultural-centric unerstanding of democracy.

I append the abstract here for the convenience of reference:

> While recent research has noted declining public support for democracy and coinciding growth in support for populist right wing political parties, it has implicitly assumed a shared understanding of democracy across time and space. In this paper, we utilize multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) and latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify the structure of public understandings of democracy as revealed through the “essential characteristics of democracy” on the World Values Survey (WVS). We find, first, that only the procedural items used in the “essential characteristics of democracy” battery are roughly equivalent cross-nationally, and even here they achieve metric but not scalar invariance. Second, we find that public understandings of democracy differ from one country to the next. In most countries, the data are best represented by three classes (or clusters) while in other countries the data are better represented by two profiles. Even when the number of profiles is the same, the pattern of findings is often different to suggest different underlying understandings of democracy across contexts.
