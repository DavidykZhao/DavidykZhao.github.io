This is the whole process of analysis for the Nativism project

This paper is inspired by Ipsos's hypothesis that it is Nativism that led to Trump's success, and such nativism is spreading across democracies. 
This paper specifically investigates the presence of “Nativism” in a global context. More specifically, is the construct of Nativism understood in the same way across different countries? 
The dataset is a global survey tapping into individual’s multiple political attitudes from Ipsos.

There are in total over 16000 participants from 22 countries. 

This is a multilevel dataset which can at least be analyzed from the individual level and the country level. 
This project has evolved to be a paper that published at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12594
