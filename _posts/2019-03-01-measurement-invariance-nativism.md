This paper is inspired by Ipsos’s hypothesis that nativism led to Trump’s success, and such nativism is spreading across democracies. This paper investigates the presence of “nativism” in a global context. More specifically, the paper intends to answer a question “is the construct of Nativism understood in the same way across different countries?” Dataset used is a global survey tapping into individual’s multiple political attitudes from Ipsos. This multilevel dataset was analyzed at both individual and the country levels. There are total of over 16000 participants from 22 countries included in the dataset.


This is a multilevel dataset which can at least be analyzed from the individual level and the country level.
