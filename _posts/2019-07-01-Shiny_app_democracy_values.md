This is a visualization app I made for a research project, it was recently presented at 2019 annual meeting of the European Political Science Association in Belfast, Ireland, June 20-22, 2019. It shows the construct democracy may not be understood in the same way acorss the world.

You could also use the app to toggle the widget to view different clusters within different countries as shown below.
You could also ask the app the generate the profile plot from the most fit of the Latent Class Model. However, this may take a while, up to 1 minute for the server to process. 

Please note that it may take a few seceonds to load.
