This is visualization app I made for a research project, recently presented at 2019 annual meeting of the
European Political Science Association in Belfast, Ireland, June 20-22, 2019. 

It echos the purpose of the research which is to show that the construct democracy may not be understood in the same way acorss 
the world. 

In the app, you could toggle the widget to view different combinations of class numbers and countries. 
You could also ask the app the generate the profile plot from the most fit of the Latent Class Model. However, this may take a while, up to 1 minute for
the server to process.
