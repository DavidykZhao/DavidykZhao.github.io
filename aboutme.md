My dissertation is titled <i>What deep learning could bring to framing analysis on Twitter</i> under the amazing supervisor <a href = "https://comm.tamu.edu/kirby-goidel/" target="_blank">Dr. Kirby Goidel</a>, the director of the <a href = "https://ppri.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Public Policy Research Institute</a> at Texas A&M University. The dissertation serves as a comprehensive experiment about the effects of diverse state-of-the-art NLP models in analysing twitter messages.

 I have 4 years experience of statistical modeling. Proficient in experimental design, predictive modeling, deep learning, structural equation modeling (SEM), mixture model methods, Bayesian inference and data visualization. Some of my work has been featured at the frontpage of [*Towards Data Science*]{https://towardsdatascience.com/@davidzhao_25439}. I am a deep learning practitioner and proficient in deep learning frameworks: fastai, Pytorch-transformers (formerly pytorch-pretrained-bert) and Pytorch.

I am an avid backpacker and crazy about national parks. <a href = "https://davidykzhao.github.io/lens-page/">Here</a> you could see some of the amateur photos I took while travling.
