My dissertation is titled <i>What deep learning could bring to framing analysis on Twitter</i> under the amazing supervisor <a href = "https://comm.tamu.edu/kirby-goidel/" target="_blank">Dr. Kirby Goidel</a>, the director of the <a href = "https://ppri.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Public Policy Research Institute</a> at Texas A&M University. The dissertation serves as a comprehensive experiment about the effects of diverse state-of-the-art NLP models in analysing twitter messages.
